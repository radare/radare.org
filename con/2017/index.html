<h1>What</h1>
The first^Wsecond official congress about <a href="http://rada.re/">radare</a>.
<br />
<br />
Highlighting all aspects of radare2, this congress brings the oportunity to everyone to learn more about manual and automated reverse engineering, static and dynamic analysis, fuzzing, forensics, exploiting, unpacking, malware, ... this congress allows everyone to understand how to use r2 and how to extend it for your own purposes, it will also serve as an excuse for all developers to meet and discuss design and implementation tips for the future of the project.
<br /> <br />
The congress will be composed by 2 days of trainings (english and spanish) and 2 days of single-track talks with parallel hackathon on open place to meet people.

<h1>Why</h1>
Because in 2016, the radare project turns 10 year old and the community and interest is big enough to fill a conference. And the project evolves pretty fast, so it makes sense to repeat the event in 2017 to celebrate the 11th anniversary.
<h1>When</h1>
September 6, 7, 8, 9
<h1>Who</h1>
Everyone: from hackers to developers, from users to companies, from curious to experts.
<br /> <br />
Tickets bought before August 15th will be rewarded with some r2 merchandising.

In addition you can save the shipping costs and get lowered prices at <a href="http://camisetasfrikis.es/44-r2-con-2016">Camisetas Frikis</a>
<br /> <br />

Please send more talks, the CFP is not closed yet, and there's no schedule defined atm.

<h1>8th - 9th Friday-Saturday Talks</h1>
<ul>
<li> r2k - kernel analyzing and debugging - @nighterman
<!--
<li> diaphora - @pancake, @joxeankoret
<li> Anal cLEMENCy
-->
<li> r2wars - @skuater, @pancake
This talk will introduce the attendees to the r2wars game, which will be one of the competitions that will happen during the congress. The game consists in writing small programs in assembly code for x86, mips, arm and z80 to make them fight until death between them. The purpose of them would be to find the other player in memory to corrupt it and make it crash. The competition is an excuse for finding bugs in the assemblers, emulators and r2 itself, and have fun together :D
<li> Hidden gems in r2land - @pancake
It is known that r2 is capable for doing lot of things but most people ignore how to use those magic tricks, the talk will show several small tricks and features that are not widely known but very handy for many situations.
<li> r2frida - @mrmacete
<li> Limits of ESIL - @killabytenow
<li> r2yara - @mmorenog + @plutec_net <br/>
  The way to use the powerful information extracted from r2 to catch malware is creating a module for Yara, that's the point! With this talks we will try to explain all the features and receive feedback from the community to improve it.
<li> Pimp my Triton - ak42
<li> Calling 096 - crowell
<li> Forensics with r2 - inromx
<li> r2 the Rhme3! - @enovella_ and Dana Geist. <br/>
The RHme (Riscure Hack me) is a low level hardware CTF that comes in the form of an Arduino board (AVR architecture). It involves a set of SW and HW challenges to test your skills in different areas such as side channel analysis, fault injection, reverse-engineering and software exploitation. In our talk we will briefly recap RHme2 and introduce the upcoming RHme3. This year we decided to create a special target called the Riscurino board which features CAN controllers for a real automotive hacking experience!<br/>During the r2con we challenge you to solve as many challenges as you can using radare2. Are you up to the task? By the time the r2con takes place the registration for RHme3 will be closed. However, we reserved  5 Riscurino boards for giving away during the conference. Be at r2con and win one of these boards by solving the qualification challenge(s) using radare2!
<li> IoT malware analysis - @dukebarman
<li> iaito - the QT GUI hteso
<li> zdbg - @zutle <br/>
The zdbg plugin hotwires r2 to a virtual machine to turn it into a stealthy kernel-mode debugger. Our Windows 10 target does not even know it is being debugged. Not only are we enabling r2 to debug code running in the kernel, but also to work as a systemwide debugger to debug multiple user-mode processes simultaneously, including those nasties that debug themselves!
<li> SIOL - @condret

<li> jemalloc heap analysis - nax0r+soez
<li> cfg based fuzzy hash - @Maxou56800 and @rbnctl
