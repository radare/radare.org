The Book
========

This book was released together with radare 1.0. Most of the concepts
are explained there, some of the examples may not be compatible with
radare2.

You can read it [online](http://radare.org/doc/html/contents.html) or
download the [PDF](http://radare.org/get/radare.pdf). 

Recently, maijin started a project to update the radare book for
radare2:

The API
=======

radare2 api (aka libr) is described in vapi files. Those files are
translated by valaswig into swig interface files to generate the
bindings for python, ruby, perl and others. 

Those [Vala](http://live.gnome.org/Vala) vapi files are at the same
time parsed by [Valadoc](http://live.gnome.org/Valadoc) to generate the
[online](http://radare.org/vdoc) documentation. 

Articles
========

Some e-zines has published articles about how to use radare in some
specific use cases.
